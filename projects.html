    	            Polar Panic is a windows phone app that I designed and created in the second half of 2015. It was coded using C#, which I taught myself in preperation for this project. <br>The object of the game is to match three of the same color of penguin in a row. When you swipe any direction, all the penguins will move in that direction until they hit another penguin or the edge of the board. It features a highscore system, which saves your score and initials to the phone so that high scores are kept between sessions.

   	             Virtual Classroom is a web application that I made with a group of three other students for a semester long class project. We created a website where anyone can sign up as the teacher of their own online course and livestream lectures to any students that are invited to the class. I was responsible for the video and chat platforms of the project. I implemented the video features using the Google Hangouts API. The teacher's livestream is automatically broadcast as a video on YouTube, and then that video can be embedded in the classroom page and saved as a link on the past lectures page. <br>The professor of the class that my group created this project for was so impressed with our work that she now uses it as an example project for the assignment.
